    <p>We study the ability of a firm to elicit repeated effort from workers by creating a "rat race" of hierarchical status-based incentives. We examine performance using data on over 5,000 German air force pilots during World War II. Pilots' effort is hard to monitor; motivation is key to success. Rather pilot performance increases markedly as they approach eligibility for a medal before falling off upon receipt of the award. The same effort path repeats itself as the pilot nears the next higher-prestige medal. Status-conscious pilots also exert more effort when new medals are introduced. We show that medals serve as substitutes for other forms of status. Medal cachet declines over time as lower-ability pilots receive them, making the introduction of new medals desirable. These results suggest that a tiered, expanding system of status-based incentives can repeatedly leverage worker status concerns to extract effort.</p>

    <p>We study the effects of mortgage forbearance on local economies and individuals. During the Great Depression, twenty-five states adopted foreclosure moratoria that temporarily disallowed lenders from seizing farms. By interrupting foreclosures during a crisis, forbearance policies can prevent fire sales, protect bank balance sheets, and dampen credit contractions. However, they may also raise the cost of capital and keep land in the hands of less productive operators. We empirically examine these trade-offs using county-level agricultural data and linked full-count census records. The results show that the moratoria protected at least 250,000 farms. Counties most exposed to mortgages—and hence foreclosure risk—experienced a persistent 15% increase in the number of farms. These protected farmers and their children were more likely to remain in agriculture and less likely to shift into manufacturing almost two decades after policy enactment. The policy pushed agricultural production toward smaller, more labor-intensive farms operating on more marginal land with lower capital intensity. By preventing consolidation, the policy depressed farm revenues and values. At the same time, the moratoria increased local borrowing costs by 10% during a period in which local interest rates converged significantly. We also find suggestive evidence that highly exposed counties developed weaker manufacturing sectors in the long run, consistent with slower labor reallocation out of agriculture. Taken together, we show that well-intentioned policies that temporarily suspend creditor remedies come with significant long-run trade-offs.</p>
