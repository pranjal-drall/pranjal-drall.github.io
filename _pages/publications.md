**The Long Run Impact of Farm Foreclosures: Evidence from the Great Depression**

I estimate the impact of farm foreclosures during the Great Depression on individuals and land over the 20th century. I exploit the passage of state foreclosure moratorium laws between 1933-1935 which temporarily prevented creditors from foreclosing on delinquent farmers in 27 states. This allows me to compare counties with similar percent of farms mortgaged across foreclosure regimes. Using linked Census microdata, I first show that farmers in counties with lower exposure to foreclosures had better labor market outcomes (earnings and wages) and were less likely to migrate in 1940. However, despite the gains for individuals, the policy caused significant and persistent relative declines in farmland values, revenues, and farm productivity over the 20th century. Manufacturing value added per worker, capital investment and productivity also see relative declines. The decrease in productivity happens at the intensive margin, as acres in farmland and the number of establishments remain steady over time for treated counties.

This paper makes three primary contributions. First, this is the first paper that tries to measure the impact of farm foreclosures on land and individuals during the Great Depression by exploiting variation in foreclosure regimes (Mian et al., 2015). Second, it shows that preventing efficient allocation of land can reduce the pace of structural transformation. The results also highlight the equity-efficiency tradeoff associated with reallocation of inputs. Third, this setting allows me to measure the causal impact of initial misallocation stemming from lower exposure to centralized land allocations (that follow foreclosures) on county-level agricultural and manufacturing productivity. Under sufficiently low transaction costs and strong property rights, market transactions should efficiently distribute productive assets regardless of their initial allocation (Coase, 1960). These results, however, suggest that costs associated with initial misallocation of capital and labor are high; even in an environment with low transaction costs, such as the United States land market (Edwards et al., 2022).

**Can Supply Shocks Facilitate Price Coordination? Evidence from the Airline Industry**

I exploit an exogenous shock to airline supply—the Boeing 737 MAX grounding—to study the pricing responses of firms to cost shocks in a concentrated industry. The grounding disproportionately affected certain carriers (Southwest) which allows me to credibly measure the cost shock's impact on pricing decisions by the legacy airlines that were relatively less affected. I first document a 5% increase in prices at the route level; this effect is stronger in more concentrated and capacity constrained markets. I also find that legacy airlines reduce prices in response to the shock while Southwest is forced to raise prices.

This earlier version won the Midwest Economics Association's Best Undergraduate Paper Prize in 2020. The project has *substntially* changed since then.

**Racial and Gender Bias in Child Maltreatment Reporting Decisions: Results of a Randomized Vignette Experiment** (with Ian Ayres and Sonia Quinn; under submission)

In this randomized vignette experiment, we asked 4,000 respondents through a YouGov survey to decide how likely they would be to report potential instances of child maltreatment to authorities. We used racialized and gendered names to suggest randomize the identities of the parents and children that respondents viewed in each of the ten vignettes that were based on real-life events they were shown. We find that respondents were less likely to report potential child maltreatment when the vignette used non-White names to describe the family participants. Respondents were less likely to report when a male child was involved, and more likely to report when a male parent was involved. The uncovered racial and gender were more pronounced in vignettes that were of intermediate severity.

**The Impact of Involuntary Outpatient Commitment Laws on Mental Health** (with Ian Ayres)

In 1971, Florida passed the "Baker Act" which allows the involuntary institutionalization and examination of an individual by judges, law enforcement officials, physicians, or mental health professionals. Similar laws have been enacted in 43 states since then. These policy changes offer an opportunity to measure the impact of involuntary commitment on health outcomes, especially suicide and gun violence. AOT laws rely on a standard of dangerousness (which varies by state) to commit individuals to outpatient facilities for a few days. This paper measures how the passage of these Involuntary Outpatient Commitment laws impact the health outcomes especially suicide rates by using within-state and across-state variation in adoption timing. We also utilize variation in mental health capacity within states to measure the heterogenous impacts of these laws.

**Trade Liberalization and Pollution: Evidence from the China Shock** [(Draft)]({{https://pranjal-drall.github.io}}/files/pollution.pdf)

This paper exploits an exogenous shock to import competition, the U.S. granting China Permanent National Trade Relations (PNTR) in 2000, to determine the effect of trade liberalization on industrial pollution. I find that increased geographic exposure to PNTR significantly reduced industrial pollution at the county level. A one unit standard deviation increase in exposure reduces PM2.5 concentration by 0.7 micrograms per cubic meter per year relative to counties that aren’t exposed. I find similar results for NO2 and SO2 concentration. These results confirm a classic prediction of trade models–that increased trade (import competition) reduces domestic pollution. They also help explain the decline in aggregate pollution from 1990-2015.

**The Impact of Replacement Stadiums on Property Values: A CPUMA Geographic Level Approach** (with Nola Agha) [(Draft)]({{https://pranjal-drall.github.io}}/files/stadiums.pdf)

Billions of dollars are spent annually constructing new facilities for professional sport teams. In recent years, a good portion of that spending is for facilities that replace existing facilities in the same city. This paper examines the role of new sporting facilities as local amenities that contribute to the value of housing prices. It investigates facilities opened between 2005 and 2017 in the top five professional leagues in the United States by utilizing a Consistent Public Use Microdata Area (CPUMA) to capture the local effect of a team and adjacent effects in bordering CPUMAs. It finds no significant effects of construction years or opening years on housing values in either the main or surrounding CPUMAs. The league for which the facility was built can be significantly positive or negative, with the effect changing depending on the specification.

This paper was written during my junior year at Grinnell. It was presented at the Western Economics Association International’s Conference (NAASE Session) in Tokyo (2019) and the Midwest Economics Association’s Annual Meetings (Undergrad Session) in St Louis (2019).
