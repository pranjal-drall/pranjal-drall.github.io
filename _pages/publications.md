**Land Misallocation and Structural Change: Evidence from The Great Depression**
 [(Draft)]({{https://pranjal-drall.github.io}}/files/farms.pdf)

 This paper studies the impact of land misallocation on the pace of structural change and the distributional consequences of this slowdown. I estimate the impact of farm foreclosures during the Great Depression on individuals and regions. While foreclosures have negative short-term effects, they can also facilitate the reallocation of labor and capital by allocating land to its most productive use through auctions. To test this hypothesis, I exploit the passage of state-level foreclosure moratorium laws, which temporarily prevented creditors from foreclosing on delinquent farmers in 27 states, to generate quasi-experimental variation in exposure to foreclosures. Using linked Census microdata, I show that preventing foreclosures improved earnings and reduced migration for farm owners and workers between 1930-1940. However, I also find that the foreclosure moratoria had persistent negative effects on land values, labor markets, and agricultural and manufacturing productivity in the long run. These results emphasize the importance of centralized allocation mechanisms in improving productivity and growth.

This paper makes three primary contributions. First, this is some of the earliest work that measures the impact of farm foreclosures on land and individuals during the Great Depression by exploiting variation in foreclosure regimes. This approach has been previously used to study foreclosures during the Great Recession (Mian et al., 2015). Second, these estimates highlight the distributional consequences of structural transformation. Preventing foreclosures at the margin slowed down the transition from agriculture to manufacturing and left land in the hands of relatively less productive farmers. This benefited some farmers in the short run but had significant negative consequences for regions over the long run. These results also indicate that US land markets, especially during the 20th century, were likely less efficient than previously thought as initial misallocation due to foreclosures has significant long run impacts (Libecap et al., 2022). Third, this paper highlights the importance of centralized allocation mechanisms on productivity and economic growth. I am able to compare the impact of allocation via centralized auctions, that typically follow foreclosures in this setting, to property transfers resulting from transactions between private parties (Hornbeck, 2010; Dippel et al., 2020; Smith, 2019; Covert and Sweeney, 2019). The estimates also highlight the significant costs associated with initial (mis)allocation of capital and land on long run development (Banerjee et al. (2002), Hsieh and Klenow (2009), Adamopoulos and Restuccia (2014), Adamopoulos and Restuccia (2020), Adamopoulos et al. (2022)).

**Can Supply Shocks Facilitate Price Coordination? Evidence from the Airline Industry** [(Draft)]({{https://pranjal-drall.github.io}}/files/airlines.pdf)

I exploit an exogenous shock to airline supply—the Boeing 737 MAX grounding—study the impact of cost shocks in airlines. The grounding disproportionately affected certain carriers (such as Southwest) and routes, allowing me to credibly measure the cost shock's impact. My differences-in-difference and event study analysis shows that the grounding led to a 5\% increase in prices at the market level, with the effect being particularly pronounced in more concentrated and capacity-constrained markets. Interestingly, I also observe that while Southwest was forced to raise prices, its rival legacy airlines actually reduced prices on affected routes. In future work, I will use a structural approach to better disentangle the effects of market power and capacity reduction on prices.

*Previous Version:* This paper was originally written for Eric Ohrn's seminar in Microeconometrics at Grinnell under the title "Market Power in Airlines: Evidence from the Boeing 737 MAX Grounding." This earlier version won the Midwest Economics Association's Best Undergraduate Paper Prize in 2020. The project has *substantially* changed since then.

**Racial and Gender Bias in Child Maltreatment Reporting Decisions: Results of a Randomized Vignette Experiment** (with Ian Ayres and Sonia Quinn; under submission)

In this randomized vignette experiment, we asked 4,000 respondents through a YouGov survey to decide how likely they would be to report potential instances of child maltreatment to authorities. We used racialized and gendered names to suggest randomize the identities of the parents and children that respondents viewed in each of the ten vignettes that were based on real-life events they were shown. We find that respondents were less likely to report potential child maltreatment when the vignette used non-White names to describe the family participants. Respondents were less likely to report when a male child was involved, and more likely to report when a male parent was involved. The uncovered racial and gender were more pronounced in vignettes that were of intermediate severity.

**The Impact of Involuntary Outpatient Commitment Laws on Mental Health** (with Ian Ayres)

In 1971, Florida passed the "Baker Act" which allows the involuntary institutionalization and examination of an individual by judges, law enforcement officials, physicians, or mental health professionals. Similar laws have been enacted in 43 states since then. These policy changes offer an opportunity to measure the impact of involuntary commitment on health outcomes, especially suicide and gun violence. AOT laws rely on a standard of dangerousness (which varies by state) to commit individuals to outpatient facilities for a few days. This paper measures how the passage of these Involuntary Outpatient Commitment laws impact the health outcomes especially suicide rates by using within-state and across-state variation in adoption timing. We also utilize variation in mental health capacity within states to measure the heterogenous impacts of these laws.

**Trade Liberalization and Pollution: Evidence from the China Shock** [(Draft)]({{https://pranjal-drall.github.io}}/files/pollution.pdf)

This paper exploits an exogenous shock to import competition, the U.S. granting China Permanent National Trade Relations (PNTR) in 2000, to determine the effect of trade liberalization on industrial pollution. I find that increased geographic exposure to PNTR significantly reduced industrial pollution at the county level. A one unit standard deviation increase in exposure reduces PM2.5 concentration by 0.7 micrograms per cubic meter per year relative to counties that aren’t exposed. I find similar results for NO2 and SO2 concentration. These results confirm a classic prediction of trade models–that increased trade (import competition) reduces domestic pollution. They also help explain the decline in aggregate pollution from 1990-2015.

**The Impact of Replacement Stadiums on Property Values: A CPUMA Geographic Level Approach** (with Nola Agha) [(Draft)]({{https://pranjal-drall.github.io}}/files/stadiums.pdf)

Billions of dollars are spent annually constructing new facilities for professional sport teams. In recent years, a good portion of that spending is for facilities that replace existing facilities in the same city. This paper examines the role of new sporting facilities as local amenities that contribute to the value of housing prices. It investigates facilities opened between 2005 and 2017 in the top five professional leagues in the United States by utilizing a Consistent Public Use Microdata Area (CPUMA) to capture the local effect of a team and adjacent effects in bordering CPUMAs. It finds no significant effects of construction years or opening years on housing values in either the main or surrounding CPUMAs. The league for which the facility was built can be significantly positive or negative, with the effect changing depending on the specification.

This paper was written during my junior year at Grinnell. It was presented at the Western Economics Association International’s Conference (NAASE Session) in Tokyo (2019) and the Midwest Economics Association’s Annual Meetings (Undergrad Session) in St Louis (2019).
