Welcome!

I am pre-doctoral fellow at the [Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago](https://epic.uchicago.edu/) with Professors Thom Covert (Booth), Ryan Kellogg (Harris) and Rich Sweeney (Boston College). I work on projects focusing on the relationship between misallocation of resources, firm learning, and lease terms on productivity in the US fracking industry.

Prior to joining EPIC, I was a Tobin pre-doctoral fellow at Yale Law School where I worked with Ian Ayres on applied micro projects in corporate finance, behavioral, and labor economics. I graduated from Grinnell College with a double major in economics and math in 2020 where I also played tennis. In the past, I worked on telecommunications and technology policy issues at the Brookings Institution, American Action Forum, and TechFreedom. I also spent a summer working as an economic consultant at the Brattle Group in Washington, DC.

I enjoy playing tennis and running in my free time.
