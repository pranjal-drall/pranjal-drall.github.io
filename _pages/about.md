I am a JD-PhD candidate in Financial Economics at Yale Law School and Yale School of Management. My research interests lie at the intersection of law, economics, and finance, with a focus on corporate law, bankruptcy, and regulatory policy.

At Yale, I serve as Executive Submissions Editor for the *Yale Journal on Regulation* and have worked as a Teaching Assistant for courses in Procedure (Harold Koh), Constitutional Law (Samuel Moyn), Business Organizations (Sarath Sanga), and Corporate Finance (Chris Clayton). I was awarded the Judge Ralph K. Winter Jr. Prize for Law and Economics.

Prior to Yale, I worked as a Predoctoral Fellow at the University of Chicago with [Thom Covert](https://www.tcovert.com/) and [Ryan Kellogg](http://kelloggryan.com/), where I developed datasets on mineral leases and production data for the US fracking industry. I also served as a Research Fellow with [Ian Ayres](https://ianayres.yale.edu/) at Yale Law School.

I hold a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics and Economics, with honors, from Grinnell College. My undergraduate thesis, *Can Supply Shocks Facilitate Collusion? Evidence from the Boeing 737 MAX Grounding*, received the Best Undergraduate Paper Prize at the Midwest Economics Association's 2020 Meeting.
