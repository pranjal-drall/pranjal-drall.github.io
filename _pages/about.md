I studying law and finance at Yale. My primary research interests are in corporate law, bankruptcy and energy. 

Prior to graduate school, I worked as a predoc at the University of Chicago with [Thom Covert](https://www.tcovert.com/) and [Ryan Kellogg](http://kelloggryan.com/), where I developed datasets on mineral leases and production data for the US fracking industry. Before that, I worked with [Ian Ayres](https://ianayres.yale.edu/) at Yale Law School where I worked on a broad range of law and economics issues. 

I graduated with a B.A. in Mathematics and Economics from Grinnell College.
