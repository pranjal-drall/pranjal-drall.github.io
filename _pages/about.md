I'm a JD-PhD student in Financial Economics at Yale Law School and the School of Management. My primary research interests are in corporate law, bankruptcy and energy. 

Prior to graduate school, I was a predoc at the Energy Policy Institute of the University of Chicago ([EPIC](https://epic.uchicago.edu/)) with [Thom Covert](https://www.tcovert.com/) and [Ryan Kellogg](http://kelloggryan.com/) where I worked on misallocation and productivity in the US fracking industry. Before that, I worked with [Ian Ayres](https://ianayres.yale.edu/) at Yale Law School where I worked on retirement menu design, gun policy, and other law and economics issues. 

I graduated with a B.A. in Mathematics and Economics from Grinnell College.
