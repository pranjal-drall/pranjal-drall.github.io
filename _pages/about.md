Welcome!

I am currently a pre-doctoral fellow at the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago ([EPIC](https://epic.uchicago.edu/)). I work with Professors Thom Covert (Booth), Ryan Kellogg (Harris), and Rich Sweeney (Boston College) on projects that focus on the relationship between misallocation of resources, firm learning, and lease terms on productivity in the US fracking industry.

Prior to joining EPIC, I was a Tobin pre-doctoral fellow at Yale Law School. In this role, I worked with Ian Ayres on applied micro projects in the fields of corporate finance, behavioral economics, and labor economics. I graduated from Grinnell College in 2020 with a double major in economics and math. While at Grinnell, I also played tennis. In the past, I have worked on telecommunications and technology policy issues at various DC based think-tanks, including the Brookings Institution and the American Action Forum. I also have experience as an economic consultant, having spent a summer working at the Brattle Group in Washington, DC.

I enjoy playing tennis and running in my free time.
