I'm a JD-PhD (Financial Economics) student at Yale with research interests in business organizations and bankruptcy. 

Prior to Yale, I worked as a predoc at the University of Chicago with [Thom Covert](https://www.tcovert.com/) and [Ryan Kellogg](http://kelloggryan.com/), where I developed datasets on mineral leases and production data for the US fracking industry. And before that, I worked with [Ian Ayres](https://ianayres.yale.edu/) at Yale Law School where I worked on a broad range of law and economics issues. I hold a B.A. in Mathematics and Economics, with honors, from Grinnell College.
